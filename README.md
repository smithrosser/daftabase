# Daftabase

This is a from-scratch key-value store implementation I've been working on to aid in my understanding of databases. Still a work in progress!

Currently only supports string entries -- up next is enabling storage of different data types, some refactoring, and various performance improvements.

## Dependencies

* Catch2 (unit tests)
* cxxopts (command-line interface)
